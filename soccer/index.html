	  <h3> Accomplishments</h3>
	  <p> Some accomplishments that I have gotten is a second place metal in a tournament. I have earned many of these troughout the years.
		  One personal accomplishment for me would be making the skyline soccer team or making my club team.</p>
	  <h3> Spotlight </h3>
	  <p> I am putting a spotlight on Javain Brown. He is a player on RSL as a defender. He stood out to me because he plays the same position 
	  as me. I went to one of the games and he caught my eye, he is a great player. he joined the team on February 17 2021. He is such a cool 
	  guy and has tons of skill.</p>
	  <h3> Timeline When I Started</h3>
	  <p> I started soccer when I was very young. Every year sense I was 3 I have been playing soccer. I played on a rec team for 6 years. Around 2020 I 
		  joined a comp. team named blast. I was on that team for 3 years then joined impact. I played wing and forward most of my years and just recently changed to defender.</p>
